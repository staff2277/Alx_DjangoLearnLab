# Django Permissions and Groups Setup

## Custom Permissions

We have added the following custom permissions to the `Article` model:

- `can_view`: Allows viewing articles.
- `can_create`: Allows creating new articles.
- `can_edit`: Allows editing articles.
- `can_delete`: Allows deleting articles.

## User Groups

We have set up the following user groups with different access levels:

- **Editors**: Can create and edit articles.
- **Viewers**: Can only view articles.
- **Admins**: Can create, edit, delete, and view articles.

## Applying Permissions in Views

Djangoâ€™s `permission_required` decorator is used in views to restrict access.

Example:

```python
@permission_required('your_app_name.can_edit', raise_exception=True)
def edit_article(request, article_id):
    ...
```
